       Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of independent India and a prominent leader in the Indian freedom struggle. Born in 1889,
        he was educated in England and became a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. Nehru played a key role in shaping modern India through his 
        vision of a secular, democratic nation with a focus on industrialization, scientific progress, and education. As Prime Minister from
         1947 to 1964, he laid the foundation for many institutions and was known for his efforts to promote peace and non-alignment in foreign
          policy. He is also remembered as "Chacha Nehru" for his love and care for children.
